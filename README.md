## Description

Soddle is a collection of daily mini games that are built around famous crypto personalities.

In our first game, players need to find the correct personality based on different hints like Age, Country of Origin or Number of Twitter Followers. In our second game, players see an infamous tweet out of the crypto history and match it to its publisher. Our third game has emojis as its core. The task of the player is to guess which crypto personality is described by them.

Each player earns points depending on the amount of guesses they need and the time they take to solve the riddle(s). We distribute rewards to the top percentage of players daily.
